## My story
I am a software engineer and recent graduate of Makers Academy. As a very inquisitive and driven individual, I am passionate about continuous learning and personal growth. After studying Psychology at University (UCL, 2015), I went into Management Consulting (EY) where I solved problems for a variety of clients across the financial services sector. In 2018, I moved to a FinTech in order to gain greater exposure to building technical products from the ground up. It was during my time there that I worked closely with developers and caught the bug for coding.. The rest is history!

## Skills

#### Adaptable and fast learner

- At EY, I demonstrated my ability to rapidly apply myself to new business problems and add value. I became used to moving to different clients and projects, even cities.
- I quickly adjusted to a diverse role within a startup Fintech environment having come from a much larger, more corporate institution. I again had to adapt to a completely different working environment, industry and role.
- At Makers, I picked up new languages and frameworks in a very short timeframe (Rails, Javascript, React). For my final project, I learnt a completely new tech stack (MERN) to build a complex app with multiple external API calls.
- In my spare time, I challenge myself to learn new skills and hobbies including public speaking, trapeze and Mandarin.
- Feedback I have received from former clients and managers include:
> ‚ÄúNatalie is a fast learner and adapts rapidly to changing situations‚Äù

> ‚ÄúNatalie has demonstrated an ability to understand new concepts in a complex IT delivery programme‚Äù

#### Emotionally intelligent
- My ability to connect and build strong relationships with others has enabled me to excel in previous roles and at Makers where pair programming and teamwork were integral to the course.
- As a management consultant and partnerships manager I worked with a diverse range of stakeholders to achieve a multitude of goals.
- Feedback I have received from a senior partner at EY:

> "Natalie built empathy with the client which was instrumental in us building the trust to eventually win the engagement. Was
proactive throughout, constantly questioned areas where she did not understand.. an infectious disposition."
